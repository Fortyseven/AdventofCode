# Part 1

You're standing in a room with "digitization quarantine" written in LEDs along one wall.
The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface. "Restricted Area - Strictly
No Digitized Users Allowed."

It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a captcha to prove you're not a
human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a
normal human, but it feels like hours to you.

The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits(your puzzle input) and find the
sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the
digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.
